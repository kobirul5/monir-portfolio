          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="text-primary font-semibold">Md Monirul Islam</span>, a passionate
          UI/UX Designer with a strong focus on creating modern, clean, and user-friendly digital
          experiences. I specialize in designing websites and interfaces using Figma, where I bring
          ideas to life through creative design and problem-solving.
          My goal is to make every project both visually appealing and highly functional so users can
          enjoy a smooth and meaningful experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          When working on projects, I follow a clear design process: starting with research and
          understanding client goals, then moving to wireframes, high-fidelity design, prototyping,
          and iteration based on feedback. This approach helps me deliver designs that balance
          creativity with usability. I believe good design is not just how it looks but how it works.
        </p>
